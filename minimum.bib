At Aesthetic Integration, we have pioneered the use of formal verification for analysing the safety and fairness of financial algorithms. With a focus on financial infrastructure (e.g., the matching logics of exchanges and dark pools and FIX connectivity between trading systems), we describe the landscape, and illustrate our Imandra formal verification system on a number of real-world examples. We sketch many open problems and future directions along the way.",

   abstract = {We present an implementation technique for a class of bottom-up logic procedures. The technique is based oncode trees. It is intended to speed up most important and costly operations, such as subsumption and resolution. As an example, we consider the forward subsumption problem which is the bottleneck of many systems implementing first-order logic. To efficiently implement subsumption, we specialize subsumption algorithms at run time, using theabstract subsumption machine. The abstract subsumption machine makes subsumption-check using sequences of instructions that are similar to the WAM instructions. It gives an efficient implementation of the “clause at a time” subsumption problem. To implement subsumption on the “set at a time” basis, we combine sequences of instructions incode trees. We show that this technique yields a new way of indexing clauses. Some experimental results are given. The code trees technique may be used in various procedures, including binary resolution, hyper-resolution, UR-resolution, the inverse method, paramodulation and rewriting, OLDT-resolution, SLD-AL-resolution, bottom-up evaluation of logic programs, and disjunctive logic programs.},

Thus, the choice of precedence has an indirect yet often substantial impact on the amount of work required to complete a proof search successfully.",

We provide a critical review of recent achievements in terms of techniques and applications. We identify eight emerging techniques, investigate their origins and updates, and finally emphasize their applications in four key scenarios, including recognition, visual tracking, semantic segmentation, and image restoration. We recognize three development stages in the past decade and emphasize research trends for future works. The summarizations, knowledge accumulations, and creations could benefit researchers in the academia and participators in the CV industries.}
