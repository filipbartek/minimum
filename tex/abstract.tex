The state-of-the-art superposition-based theorem provers for \acrlong{fol} rely on simplification orderings on terms to constrain the applicability of inference rules,
which in turn shapes the ensuing search space.
The popular Knuth-Bendix simplification ordering is parameterized by symbol precedence---a permutation of the predicate and function symbols of the input problemâ€™s signature.
Thus, the choice of precedence has an indirect yet often substantial impact on the amount of work required to complete a proof search successfully.

This work describes and evaluates two approaches to the construction of a symbol precedence recommender.
Each of them uses machine learning to predict the best possible precedence.
Both recommenders are trained on observations of prover performance on a set of problems and random precedences.
The first approach uses a small set of simple human-engineered symbol features.
The second approach uses a \acrfull{gcn} to extract meaningful symbol embeddings from the graph structure of the input problem.
When coupled with the theorem prover Vampire and evaluated on the \acrshort{tptp} problem library, the \acrshort{gcn}-based recommender is found to outperform a state-of-the-art heuristic by more than \SI{4}{\percent} on unseen problems.
