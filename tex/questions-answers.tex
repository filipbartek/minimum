\begin{frame}{Question 2}
\begin{block}{Question}
What methods are considered to be applied for integration of the proving strategy and schedule optimization?
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{Answer}
Combine \gls{smbo} with fast schedule optimization. Iteratively construct a portfolio:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Train a probabilistic \gls{epm}.
\item Estimate value of new strategies using the \gls{epm},
empirical runtimes of the portfolio, and
fast schedule optimization.
\item Empirically evaluate the best strategy.
\item Expand the portfolio if the new strategy improves it.
\end{enumerate}

Will these datasets be available for re-use by public?
\end{block}
\begin{exampleblock}{Comment}
The source code has been published.

I hope to publish the datasets when I consolidate the results for my dissertation thesis.
