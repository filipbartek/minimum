We would like to let you know that according to the Doctoral study code  your deadline for the completion of your Study Block is approaching and therefore you have to pass the Professional Debate (aka Thesis Proposal Defense or “Minimum”) and the State Doctoral Exam (SDE). We would appreciate your cooperation and feedback as soon as possible. 

In order to apply for the Professional Debate /Debate/, the student needs a total of 27 credits, of which 3 must be for publishing. The number of credits will be checked at the end of the semester, i.e. in February. For the State Doctoral Exam (SDE) it is necessary to have 3 additional credits for publishing activities (a total of 30 credits, of which 6 for publishing activities).  More information about SDE below. Should you wish to update your semester evaluation for recently acquired credits, please let us know and we will open the evaluation for you. Should you have any questions related to this, please contact me at rosicpe1@fel.cvut.cz.

In order to continue your studies, it is essential for you to pass the Debate by March 30th at the latest (if you have started on September 1, 2019). For the Doctoral Study Programmes Bioengineering and Informatics, there is a new possibility to conduct the Professional Debate and the SDE at the same time. We recommend taking advantage of this possibility. In particular, in the joint version the student will be asked only topics directly related to his/her thesis, while if the SDE is held separately, he/she might be examined on the entire knowledge field relevant to his/her field of study, as specified by the state exam topics.

To apply for the Debate you need to fill in the Application for debate and attach a list of your publications and a tentative abstract of your report (thesis proposal). To submit an application for SDE fill in the SDE Application form. The joint exam /SDE + Debate/ is planned for the second half of March 2022 (to be confirmed) We ask you to submit the application by January 11.
